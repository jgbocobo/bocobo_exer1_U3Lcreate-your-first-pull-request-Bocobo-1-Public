As a student in this course, I expect to gain a clear understanding of the material and develop the skills necessary to apply what Iâ€™ve learned. I hope the instructor provides clear guidance, feedback, and opportunities for engagement, while creating an environment where questions are welcomed. I aim to stay organized, complete assignments on time, and actively participate in class to make the most of this learning experience.
I agree with my partners expectations for this class because I also have the same expectations with him. I also hope for the instructor to guide as well during our stay in his class.
